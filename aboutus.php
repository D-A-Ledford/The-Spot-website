		<h2><center>
			Our mission at The Spot Food Trucks is to serve locally grown and raised vegetables as well as quality meats, cheeses and breads at an affordable price at multiple locations along the coast of South Carolina for the convenience of our busy and valued customers.
		</center></h2>
			<h2><center>
			We provide more choices for our customers by giving them the option of wheat and gluten-free bread as well as a vegetarian sandwich. We aim to serve those in the work field by eliminating time wasted in heavy traffic while providing quality healthy meals on the go.
		</center></h2>
		<h2><center>
			Since we have two mobile food trucks, we plan to be at different locations during lunch time each day of the week so that we can provide all our customers with the quality and convenience they deserve. Our customers can even order ahead of time so their meal is ready when they arrive.
